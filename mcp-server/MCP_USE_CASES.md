## Executive Summary

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server serves as the primary interface between Claude and the KnowledgeServer during active software development. It enables Claude to maintain, query, and update a comprehensive knowledge graph of code architecture, dependencies, and patterns in real-time. This document outlines the use cases from most common to edge cases, ensuring our implementation covers all necessary scenarios.

## Core Philosophy: The Pit of Success

The primary goal of the KnowledgeServer is to enable Claude to fall into the "pit of success" - to get things right the first time by having immediate access to:
- **Established patterns** - How things are done in this codebase
- **Architecture conventions** - The accepted ways to structure code
- **Available utilities** - What already exists vs. what needs to be created
- **Domain knowledge** - Deep understanding of business logic and requirements
- **Best practices** - Project-specific standards and conventions

This prevents the iteration cycle of "write code → discover it doesn't follow conventions → rewrite" and instead enables "understand patterns → write correct code immediately."

## Purpose and Goals

The MCP server enables:
- **Pattern-aware development** - Write code that follows established conventions from the start
- **Real-time knowledge access** during coding sessions
- **Automated knowledge capture** as code is written/modified
- **Intelligent code analysis** through graph traversal
- **Consistency maintenance** across the codebase
- **Context preservation** between Claude sessions

## 1. Most Common Use Cases (Daily Operations)

These operations occur multiple times per coding session and must be optimized for speed and accuracy.

### 1.1 Pattern Discovery and Compliance (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **"Show me how API endpoints are structured in this project"**
  - Pattern search: `detect_patterns(patternType: "api-endpoint", project: "KnowledgeServer")`
  - ✅ Example retrieval: `search_by_tag(tag: "api", project: "KnowledgeServer", limit: 5)`
  
- [ ] **"What's the pattern for React components with forms?"**
  - Pattern + tag search: `detect_patterns(domain: "ui", patternType: "form-component")`
  - ✅ Get examples: `search_by_tag(tag: "form", project: "MyApp")` → `get_vertex()` for each
  
- [ ] **"How is Redux state managed in this app?"**
  - Pattern analysis: `detect_patterns(domain: "state", project: "MyApp")`
  - ✅ Find utilities: `search_by_domain(domain: "state-management", project: "MyApp")`
  
- [ ] **"What's the established error handling pattern?"**
  - Pattern search: `detect_patterns(patternType: "error-handling")`

  - Reverse dependency trace: `get_edges(from: "getUserById-id", direction: "reverse", type: "CALLS")`
  
- [ ] **"What does the login function depend on?"**
  - Forward dependency trace: `analyze_dependencies(vertexId: "login-id", direction: "forward")`
  
- [ ] **"Will changing this function signature break anything?"**
  - Impact analysis: `analyze_impact(vertexId: "function-id", changeType: "modify")`

### 1.4 Code Understanding
- [ ] **"Show me the details of the processPayment function"**
  - Get vertex details: `get_vertex(id: "processPayment-id")`
  
- ✅ **"How are these two components connected?"**
  - Path finding: `graph_traversal(startId: "componentA-id", targetId: "componentB-id")`
  
- [ ] **"What models/types does this function use?"**
  - Relationship query: `get_edges(from: "function-id", type: "USES")`

### 1.5 Real-time Knowledge Updates

## 5. API Requirements Derived from Use Cases

### 5.1 Critical Requirements for Pattern-Driven Development
- **Pattern Detection**: Must efficiently identify and return patterns with examples
- **Pattern Comparison**: Ability to compare implementations against patterns
- **Example Retrieval**: Quick access to reference implementations
- **Utility Discovery**: Fast search for existing utilities and helpers
- **Convention Checking**: Validate that new code follows established patterns

### 5.2 Essential Query Capabilities
- **Compound Filtering**: Must support multiple filter criteria (project + tag + domain)
- **Pattern-Based Search**: Find all vertices that implement a specific pattern
- **Similarity Search**: Find similar implementations or patterns
- **Bidirectional Traversal**: Both forward and reverse dependency tracing
- **Rich Query Results**: Return full context (names, descriptions, examples)

### 5.3 Performance Requirements  
- **Response Time**: <100ms for pattern and utility searches (with caching)
- **Pattern Matching**: <200ms for pattern detection operations

- **Compliance Tracking**: Mark vertices as compliant with specific patterns
- **Anti-Pattern Detection**: Identify deviations from established patterns
- **Pattern Templates**: Provide templates for common patterns
- **Best Practice Documentation**: Link patterns to their rationale

## 6. Pattern Management Decisions

1. **Pattern Evolution**: When patterns change, document the new pattern with exemplar functions/files, mark old patterns as deprecated, and provide migration guidance.

2. **Pattern Conflicts**: When multiple patterns could apply, notify the user about conflicting patterns and request guidance on which to follow.

3. **Pattern Discovery**: ✅ Auto-detect patterns from code whenever possible to keep the context database current.

4. **Compliance Enforcement**: Future feature - Enable queries like "find non-compliant API routes" and generate refactoring plans.

5. **Pattern Templates**: Future feature - Code generation from patterns (powerful but complex to implement).

6. **Cross-Project Patterns**: ✅ Share patterns across projects for enterprise consistency.

7. **Pattern Metrics**: Future feature - Track pattern adoption and success rates.

8. **Learning Mode**: ✅ System should learn new patterns from Claude's implementations.

## 7. Implementation Priority

Based on the "pit of success" philosophy:

### Phase 1 (Essential - Current Implementation)
- ✅ Search tools (domain, tag, project with combinations)
- ⏳ Pattern detection tools (CRITICAL for pit of success)
- ⏳ Detail retrieval tools (get vertex, edges, traversal)
- ⏳ Utility discovery tools
- ⏳ Basic CRUD (create, update, delete vertices and edges)
- ⏳ Dependency analysis tools

### Phase 2 (Important - Next Steps)
- Impact analysis tools  
- Pattern compliance checking
- Bulk update operations
- Advanced traversal options
- Anti-pattern detection

### Phase 3 (Nice to Have - Future)
- Pattern template generation
- Export/import tools
- Cross-project pattern sharing
- Custom query execution
- Pattern learning from code

## 8. Success Metrics

The MCP server implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Pattern Compliance**: Claude follows established patterns 95% of the time
2. **First-Time Success**: 90% of Claude's implementations are correct on first attempt
3. **Utility Reuse**: 80% reduction in duplicate utility creation
4. **Context Efficiency**: 70% reduction in files Claude needs to read
5. **Performance**: Responds in <100ms for pattern/utility queries
6. **Developer Satisfaction**: Measurable reduction in back-and-forth iterations

## 9. The Pit of Success Checklist

For every new feature request, Claude should be able to quickly answer:
- [ ] What patterns apply to this feature?
- [ ] What utilities already exist that I can use?
- [ ] What are the examples of similar implementations?
- [ ] What conventions must I follow?
- [ ] What anti-patterns should I avoid?
- [ ] How does this fit into the existing architecture?
- [ ] What dependencies will this create?
- [ ] What impact will changes have?

## Notes

This document emphasizes the critical importance of pattern-driven development in achieving the "pit of success." The MCP server must make it easier to follow patterns than to deviate from them, ensuring Claude produces high-quality, consistent code from the start. Regular updates to patterns and continuous learning from successful implementations will keep the knowledge base relevant and valuable.
